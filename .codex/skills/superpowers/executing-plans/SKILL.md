# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks
For each task: Mark as in_progress, follow each step exactly, run verifications as specified, mark as completed.

### Step 3: Complete Development
After all tasks complete and verified, use the `/finish-branch` command.

## When to Stop and Ask for Help
STOP when: hit a blocker, plan has critical gaps, you don't understand an instruction, verification fails repeatedly. Ask for clarification rather than guessing. Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent.
